# Steps to reproduce what I have done 

## 1. Download
First download the extension from https://github.com/dis-moi/extension/releases (here we use the Google Chrome version), unpack it using available tools.

## 2. Install Xcode 13 
Xcode needs to be version 13 (found here https://xcodereleases.com/ ), at this time it is still in Beta version. Version 12 will also work, but you won't be able to build for ios devices (Ipad & Iphone)
If Xcode is already installed make sure that the xcrun version in the terminal is at least 60. To check : 
```
xcrun --version
```
